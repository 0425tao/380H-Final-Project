			    <h2>About the debate</h2>
				<p>There is a great controversy as to whether Internet censorship is essential 
				to maintain a moral standard. 
				Even if there is no consensus on this hot topic,
				people should pay attention to this issue because of potential dangers and threats.
				During the past years the Internet has enabled common people to gain information on a global scale. 
				As the Internet industry keeps growing and expanding, Internet censorship and freedom issues continue to rise.
				Internet free countries are exposed of pornography to children, 
				illegal online gambling and the cyber violence, 
				while other countries with Internet censorship faced freedom violation and economic difficulties. 
				This page analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of Internet censorship, using China as a reference. </p>
			    <br>
				<h2>Advantages</h2>
				<ul><li>Censorship filters BAD contents</li>
				<br>
				<p>The press and the people have limited access to information and politics. 
				This may be beneficial. 
				First of all, censorship makes people “calm” because they do not have access to potentially disruptive knowledge and the means to instigate protest (Lin 168). 
				Chinese government did a great job on restricting pornography websites: not only child pornography, but also adult pornography. 
				It is believed that watching pornography is negatively correlated with work/study performance. 
				Therefore, by restricting the adult sites, citizens can be less distracted from the workplace.
				Secondly, an increasing amount of fraudulent information will demoralize a country. 
				Before 2016 US presidential election, numerous media and individuals disseminated false news related to both candidates,
				which clearly led to a potential dissection of the country. 
				Party supporters attacked their rivals, both in actions and in words. 
				People have rights to learn about their future leaders, 
				but the candidates might be misrepresented by the media and the Internet. 
				If someone says 100 times that the USA is the largest country in the world, 
				you will begin to suspect your existed knowledge and trust this false statement. 
				Last but not the least, censorship reduces unnecessary fears. On early December 2016, 
				the USCNY exchange rate reached 6.88 (one USD for 6.88 CNY). 
				On December.5, the value quoted by Google skyrocketed to 7.44 (it was a mistake!) 
				and lasted for several hours. Immediately, this news became the top issue that day. M
				edia posted this news online, with exaggerated descriptions and interpretations. 
				People with no financial knowledge got into panic and felt pessimistic for their future li
				ving in the United States. Some raised the potential economic war between USA and China; 
				some attempted to sell US dollar and buy Chinese Yuan. However, it ended up Google made a mistake quoting from its source, XE, whose traders wrongly interpreted one data value in calculating the exchange rate. If there were a decent level of news censorship, the media would not be able to spread irresponsible news that raised the public panic.
 
</p>
				
				</ul>
				<br>
				</li>
				<h3> Disadvantages</h3>
				<br>
				<ul>
				    <li>The netizens will not have power in exposing corrupt officials</li>
					<br>
					<p>Although individuals could not publish news articles without journalistic accreditation, netizens are able to blog, share, network, and tweet on the Internet. If government monitors individual expressions on Internet, it will be inefficient to find corrupted officials and guarantee basic human rights.
 An example is the case of Tang Hui in China.
 In 2012, her 11-year-old daughter was raped and kidnapped by a man and she protested against the police.
 Later, without a court trial, she was sent to the labor camp, where she found the police used faked evidence to alleviate 
 the sentences of that man because he had relatives work for the local government. According to Yan, Weibo (Chinese Twitter)
 users posted over 700 thousand comments about Tang’s story and created a campaign to save her. After the Internet pressure,
 the police released Tang and gave her compensation. Furthermore, the rapist, policemen and the government officials were penalized.
</p>

                    <br>
					<li> Could not magnify social problems</li>
					<br>
					<p>Netizens utilize the Internet as an active forum for discussions about social concerns. 
					According to Lu, the Internet is a convenient space to organize protests because “no physical effort is required”. 
					The case of Tang Hui shows the ability of netizens to rally “virtual online movements” 
					and help underprivileged people to regain social concerns. 
</p>
                    <br>
					<li>Double edged sword for economic development
					</li>
					<br>
					<p>Imagine: on-the-ground multinational industry coalitions and chambers of commerce, seemingly uncoupled from their embassies, successfully lobbying the Chinese government.  But in fact, this kind of behavior was exceedingly rare.  We may have had the power, but we also had a strange unwillingness to use it.
<br></p>
<p>Written by Ethan Gutmann, the above paragraph showed international businesses have the potential to change China’s censorship method if attempted. Truly, Internet censorship could affect the economic development. A detailed relationship between the Internet freedom level and the per capita GDP is indicated in the graph below. The bigger bubble indicates higher GDP per capita level. As we can see, for example, Iceland has the highest Internet penetration score, the lowest Internet freedom score and one of the largest GDP per capita level in the world. Similarly, United States, Canada and United Kingdom all showed similar features. However, the more information exposure is, the more insecure personal privacy will be. Same for the potential information threats. The removal of Internet censorship could therefore lead to business tricks and legal violation. Few big name websites are blocked in China because of privacy threats. Youtube, Twitter and Google could not be accessed, and recently Instagram is on that list. The social media restriction in China made the local businesses like Baidu (Google in China), Tencent (Facebook in China) and Alibaba (Amazon in China, though Amazon is still active) both domestically and internationally competitive, represented by their stock price per share and global performance.
</p>
<br>
<p>The Internet arrived in China in 1994 to support the market economy. Since then, the Internet has become a common communication platform and an important tool for sharing information. With the accumulation of foreign direct investments after joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, 
China has become one of the largest exporting countries in the world. 
The quickest way to reach foreign investors and partners is through online communication. 
In this way, partnership is formed and deals are reached.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Let’s look at why Google gradually removed its operations and services in China through going over some quick facts of Google as a searching engine in China:
</p>
<br>
<p>
Google omitted references to sensitive topics and words;
Google’s comprehensive searches could not be viewed and Internet users will see the following notice: “this page cannot be found” or “The searching contains sensitive words that have been compromised based on government laws”;
Google has lost market value because of its Chinese counterpart, Baidu, who is better at controlling searching options (Dann and Haddow 226);
People cannot get access to Gmail since 2014 unless using virtual private network (VPN);
Chinese government randomly blocks Google Hong Kong for unknown reasons (Yan 400);

</p>
					
				</ul>
				<br>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			   <p>In conclusion, the development of the Internet highlights the power of the netizens. People must actively and rationally regard the Internet as an effective vehicle of information, and use the Internet to monitor government corruption and social activities. With the Internet, netizens are more aware of political realities and are able to promote socio-political change. The Internet censorship exists because there is an issue of information misuse. A decent level of censorship, especially for pornography, gambling and cyber terrorism, is urgent and beneficial.
